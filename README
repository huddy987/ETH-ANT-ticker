Running instructions:

1. Import this project to PlatformIO
2. Prior to beginning, flash the S212 softdevice to your board.
3. Drop the ANT_s212_nrf52_7.0.1.API folder in the ANT_softdevice directory.
4. Replace the nrf52_xxaa.ld at C:\Users\<you>\platformio\packages\framework-arduinonordicnrf5\cores\nRF5\SDK\components\toolchain\gcc
   with the one found at link/nrf52_xxaa.ld.
5. Edit C:\Users\<you>\platformio\platforms\nordicnrf52\builder\main.py:
      Need to edit the line where the nrfjprog flags are set to not erase the entire SoC (or else we erase the softdevice!!!)
      For me it is line 312, change the conditional to only be sectorerase and never chiperase.
6. Build and upload the project using build and upload in platformio.

Additional notes:
   - The platformio debugger will not work. For some reason it gets stuck in the softdevice calls.
