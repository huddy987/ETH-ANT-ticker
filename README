Running instructions:

1. Import this project to PlatformIO
2. Prior to beginning, build the S340 v6.1.1 adafruit bootloader here and load it: https://github.com/huddy987/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader
3. Drop the ANT_s340_nrf52840_6.1.1.API folder in the ANT_softdevice directory.
4. Replace the linker script .platformio\packages\framework-arduinoadafruitnrf52\cores\nRF5\linker\nrf52840_s140_v6.ld with the one located
   in the "link" folder.
5. On line 312 of .platformio\platforms\nordicnrf52\builder\main.py remove the conditional chiperase for jlink programming
6. Build and upload the project in platformio.

Additional notes:
   - The platformio debugger will not work. For some reason it gets stuck in freeRTOS and softdevice calls.
   - For any adaptations using this approach, NRF_POWER must be released before enabling the SD or you will get
     NRF_ERROR_SDM_INCORRECT_INTERRUPT_CONFIGURATION returned from the API
